#### 🎯 **Goal of this part:**

By the end, the game will have:

- A **world map grid** with rooms (houses, cafes, etc.)
- Players can **move around the map**
- Players can **enter rooms and interact**
- Each room has **its own grid**, **players** and **items**

---

### 📚 **Roadmap steps:**

---

**Step 1: Room system**

✅ Room model — already done (small improvements)

✅ Room routes — already done (small improvements)

⬜ World grid page (frontend) → show list of rooms at (x,y)

⬜ Add support for room "type" → cafe, shop, minigame, house

⬜ Players can click room → enter room grid

⬜ Players can leave room → return to world grid

---

**Step 2: Player movement**

⬜ Separate player list per room

⬜ When in world grid → one player list

⬜ When in room → different player list

⬜ Moving across rooms works seamlessly

---

**Step 3: Items and interaction**

⬜ Place items inside room (chairs, food, furniture)

⬜ Players can interact (sit, use, etc.)

⬜ Add simple chat inside room

---

**Step 4: Room ownership**

⬜ Users can own rooms

⬜ Can lock rooms / set public or private

⬜ Can decorate room with items
